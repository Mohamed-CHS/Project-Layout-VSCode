### General Overview

The VS Code extension, named "Project Layout," is designed to visualize a codebase's organization by creating a text-based project layout. Users can export this layout in different formats such as plain text, Markdown, or JSON. The configuration and functionality of this extension are defined in two main files: `package.json`, which describes the extension's properties and dependencies, and `extension.js`, which contains the main logic.
