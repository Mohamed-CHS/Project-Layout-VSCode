Some suggested improvements and additions, ordered by the relative ease of implementation:

### Easy to Implement

1. **Add Export to Clipboard Feature**:
   - Allow users to directly copy the generated layout to their clipboard in addition to saving it as a file. This could be done by integrating with the system clipboard.

2. **Enhance Error and Success Messages**:
   - Provide more detailed and user-friendly error or success messages to offer a better user experience.

3. **Customizable Styling for Markdown Output**:
   - Allow users to specify custom Markdown styles, like headers, bullet points, or indentation.

4. **Integration with `.gitignore` File**:
   - Allow the extension to automatically recognize and ignore files and directories specified in the `.gitignore` file.

### Moderate Difficulty

5. **Interactive Configuration Wizard**:
   - Create an interactive wizard that guides users through setting up their configuration, offering a more intuitive way to customize the extension.

6. **Add Preview Feature**:
   - Implement a live preview feature that lets users see a real-time preview of the layout as they change settings.

7. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Investigate potential performance bottlenecks, especially for large codebases, and optimize accordingly.

### More Complex to Implement

8. **Support for Additional Output Formats**:
   - Extend the extension to support other formats like XML, HTML, or even graphical representations, which could require substantial development effort.

9. **Integration with Other Tools and Platforms**:
   - Allow the extension to integrate with other tools or platforms, like GitHub or GitLab, to directly push the generated layout files or create related documentation.

10. **Automated Testing for the Extension**:
   - Implement comprehensive automated tests to ensure the robustness of the extension. This would include unit tests for each utility function, integration tests for main functionality, and end-to-end tests to validate the entire flow.
